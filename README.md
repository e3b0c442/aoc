# Advent of Code
This repository documents my solutions to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding problem series. Discussions
of these problems and solutions can be found on my
[website](https://e3b0c442.dev).

## Layout
The repository is laid out as follows. If you would like to try your own input
files, place them into the root folder for the year named `DAYNUM`.txt,
replacing `DAYNUM` with the number of the day, e.g. `1.txt`.

Each year may have any number of languages implemented, as I utilize these
problems as a learning and teaching tool.

```
|-YEAR
    |-LANG1
    |   |-source1
    |   |-...
    |   |-source25
    |...
    |-LANGX
    |   |-source1
    |   |-...
    |   |-source25
    |
    |-input1.txt
    |-input2.txt
    |-...
    |-input25.txt
